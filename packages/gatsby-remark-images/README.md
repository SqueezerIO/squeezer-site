# gatsby-remark-images

Processes images in markdown so they can be used in the production build.

In the processing, it make images responsive by:

* Adding an elastic container to hold the size of the image while it
  loads to avoid layout jumps.
* Generating multiple versions of images at different widths and sets the
  `srcset` and `sizes` of the `img` element so regardless of the width of the
  device, the correct image is downloaded.
* Useing the "blur up" technique popularized by [Medium][1] and [Facebook][2]
  where a small 20px wide version of the image is shown as a placeholder
  until the actual image is downloaded.

            // the content container as this plugin uses this as the
            // base for generating different widths of each image.
            maxWidth: 590,
